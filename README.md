# LuxRender Native Examples

## About

This project aims to produce a set of LuxRender scene files in the standard luxrender file format that show how to use all fo the built in features of LuxRender without having to export from blender or another 3d modelling package.

## Usage

The material-examples.lxs or texture-examples.lxs files can be opend by LuxRender. The materials file shows all of the standard material types applied to the LuxBall object and also includes volumes and light emitting objects.  The texture file includes the built in luxrender procedural textures.
